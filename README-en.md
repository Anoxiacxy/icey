#### Local Judge

```bash
icey [OPTION]... DATA... CODE...
```

Where `DATA` is a directory and `CODE` is a file, means use the data in the `DATA` directory to judge the `CODE` code.

#### About DATA

`DATA` must be a no-empty directory.

This directory can be an absolute path to the system or a relative path to the current working directory.

In this directory, several test data can be stored, and the format of each set of test data is

```
name1.in
name1.out
```

which is `name` + `number` + `.in/.out` .

icey will identify and pair files in this format from the directory. The name of the test data can be empty, but must have a number that matches each other.

~~In addition，you can use`-i=IN`，`-o=OUT` to specify the suffix of the test data.~~

#### About CODE

`CODE` must be a no-empty file.

This file can be an absolute path to the system or a relative path to the current working directory.

It is a source code written in C++.

Please make sure that no functions such as `freopen` are used in the program to avoid affecting the judge results.

#### About [OPTION]

These parameters are optional and can be added as needed when you need them.

|      Format       | description                                                  |

| -t, --time=SECOND | You can set the time limit for each test data in seconds, which can be a floating point number. The default is 1 |
|    -c, -C[opt]    | You can add compile options. For example, you want to add `-O2`, you can add the parameter `-CO2`.If you want to use `c++11`, the compile option `-std=c++11`, you can add the parameter `-Cstd=c++11` |
